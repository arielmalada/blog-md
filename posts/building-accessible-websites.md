# Building Accessible Websites

Web accessibility ensures that websites and web applications can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility is not just about compliance—it's about:

- **Inclusivity** - Ensuring everyone can use your website
- **Legal compliance** - Meeting ADA and WCAG requirements
- **Better UX** - Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **SEO benefits** - Search engines favor accessible content

## WCAG Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide four main principles:

### 1. Perceivable
- Provide text alternatives for images
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable to different presentations

### 2. Operable
- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Don't use content that causes seizures

### 3. Understandable
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
- Maximize compatibility with assistive technologies

## Best Practices

### Semantic HTML
Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<nav>...</nav>
<main>...</main>
<article>...</article>
<aside>...</aside>
<footer>...</footer>
```

### ARIA Attributes
Use ARIA when semantic HTML isn't enough:

```html
<button aria-label="Close dialog">×</button>
<div role="main">Main content</div>
```

## Conclusion

Building accessible websites is an ongoing process that requires attention to detail and regular testing. Start with semantic HTML, ensure keyboard navigation works, provide proper alt text, and test with real users when possible.
