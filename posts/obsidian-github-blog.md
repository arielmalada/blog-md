# How to Connect Obsidian to GitHub Pages for Seamless Blogging

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking app that works with Markdown files. By connecting it to your GitHub Pages blog, you can create a seamless writing workflow that automatically publishes your posts. In this guide, I'll show you how to set up this integration.

## What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a:
- **Markdown-based** note-taking application
- **Local-first** with optional cloud sync
- **Highly extensible** with community plugins
- **Graph view** for linking ideas
- **Perfect for writers** who love Markdown

## Why Connect Obsidian to GitHub Pages?

### Benefits of This Setup:

- âœ… **Write in Obsidian** - Use your favorite writing environment
- âœ… **Markdown native** - No conversion needed
- âœ… **Git integration** - Version control for your posts
- âœ… **Automatic publishing** - Push to publish
- âœ… **Local development** - See changes before publishing
- âœ… **Plugin ecosystem** - Extend functionality as needed

## Method 1: GitHub Integration Plugin

### Step 1: Install the Git Plugin

1. **Open Obsidian Settings** (gear icon)
2. **Go to Community plugins**
3. **Browse** and search for **"Git"**
4. **Install** the **"Obsidian Git"** plugin
5. **Enable** the plugin

### Step 2: Configure Git Integration

1. **Open plugin settings** for Obsidian Git
2. **Set your repository path** to your blog folder
3. **Configure authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Use personal access token
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Auto-Push

In the plugin settings:
- **Enable auto-push** after file modifications
- **Set push delay** (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Configure which folders** to sync (e.g., only `posts/`)

## Method 2: Obsidian Publish (Alternative)

### Obsidian's Built-in Publishing

1. **Go to Obsidian Settings**
2. **Navigate to "Publish"**
3. **Connect your site** to Obsidian Publish
4. **Configure publishing settings**

> **Note**: This creates a separate site, not integrated with your GitHub Pages blog.

## Method 3: Custom Workflow with Scripts

### Create Publishing Scripts

Create a script in your blog repository:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# publish-from-obsidian.sh

echo "Publishing from Obsidian vault..."

# Copy files from Obsidian vault to blog posts directory
cp ~/Documents/Obsidian/Vault/Blog-Posts/*.md posts/

# Add frontmatter if missing
for file in posts/*.md; do
    if ! head -1 "$file" | grep -q "^---"; then
        # Add frontmatter template
        sed -i '1i---\ntitle: '"$(basename "$file" .md | sed 's/-/ /g' | sed 's/\b\w/\U&/g')"'\
date: '"$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"'\
excerpt: Add your excerpt here\
---\n' "$file"
    fi
done

# Commit and push
git add posts/
git commit -m "Update blog posts from Obsidian"
git push origin main

echo "Published successfully!"
```

### Automate with Obsidian Commands

1. **Install Advanced URI plugin** in Obsidian
2. **Create custom commands** for publishing

5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for CI/CD to complete
6. **Check live site** - your post is published!

### Automated Publishing:

```yaml
# In your publishing script
#!/bin/bash

# Auto-publish script
echo "Checking for new posts..."

# Find modified files in Obsidian vault
find ~/Obsidian/Vault -name "*.md" -newer ~/last-publish-time.txt

# Copy to blog posts directory
# Add frontmatter
# Commit with auto-generated message
# Push to trigger deployment

echo "Published new posts!"
```
